# puts automatically adds a newline (\n) after each argument it outputs.
# print does not add a newline after the output so if you want the output on separate lines, you need to explicitly add \n yourself

puts "Hello"   # Outputs: Hello (with newline)
print "Hello"  # Outputs: Hello (without newline)
